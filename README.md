## TEST

Create a product collection page using this <a href="https://www.nuxtjs.org">Nuxt</a> project, to the best of your ability. Try and implement as many best practices as possible. Using the figma file, try and replicate the design as accuratly as possible. There is also a JSON file to replicate a response from an API. Once you are done, submit a pull request to this repo.

We will be looking for your knowledge in the following areas:
- Well formed HTML (bonus for HTML5)
- Responsive design, the page should look good on mobile and desktop (bonus for pure css)
- Javascript, use Vue and Nuxt where best applied.
- SEO friendly
- Accessibility (WCAG)
- Performance (load time, weight, etc.)

Nice to haves:
- Animations / transitions where applicable (eg: a nice hovering effect on a button).
- Reusable components that make sense.
- A site layout that can be used on multiple pages
- Translations (i18n)
- Functionality to filter products
- Live version we can test online

Do not display products with errors, in this case a product is in error if there is no image available.
